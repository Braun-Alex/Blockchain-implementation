# Blockchain implementation

Project will implement blockchain as class for using it to manage cryptocurrency.
The data structure is model of real blockchains such as used blockchains in Bitcoin and Ethereum.

## üöÄ Overview

Blockchain will permit to manage cryptocurrency in decentralized manner. It will
achieve by the main class "Blockchain" and additional, but necessary classes "Signature", 
"KeyPair", "Account", "Operation", "Transaction" and "Block".

#### Interfaces

| Interface   | Requirements for interface                                                                    |
| :---------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Signature   | Should implement **ECDSA**.                                                                   |
| KeyPair     | Must implement convenient way to use **private** and **public** keys.                         |
| Account     | Must implement **the main** entity in blockchain interface. Represents end user of system.    |
| Operation   | Must implement **atomic** transaction.                                                        |
| Transaction | **The main** way to interacting account with blockchain.                                      | 
| Block       | Must implement block of transactions.                                                         |
| Blockchain  | **The main interface**. Must implement block history and databases of coins and transactions. |

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Features

- [x] Using of the blockchain may be possible only with using of pointed interfaces.
- [x] Product does not interact with any internal products and components except used libraries.
- [x] Classes do not provide for all scenarios of its using. User should be careful with them.
- [x] High security standards with using ECDSA and SHA3.
- [x] Blockchain interface may be used by anyone without any restrictions.
