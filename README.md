# Blockchain implementation

The project implements a blockchain as a class for managing cryptocurrency.
The data structure serves as a model of real blockchains, such as those used in Bitcoin and Ethereum.

## üöÄ Overview

The blockchain enables the decentralized management of cryptocurrency. Is is accomplished using the main class "Blockchain" and additional, but essential, classes 
including "Signature", "KeyPair", "Account", "Operation", "Transaction", and "Block".

#### Interfaces

| Interface   | Requirements for interface                                                                                  |
| :---------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Signature   | Must implement **ECDSA**.                                                                                   |
| KeyPair     | Must implement convenient way to use the **private** and **public** keys.                                   |
| Account     | The main entity in the blockchain interface must be implemented. It represents the end user of the system.  |
| Operation   | Must implement the **atomic** transaction.                                                                  |
| Transaction | **The main** way to interact with an account on the blockchain.                                             | 
| Block       | Must implement the block of transactions.                                                                   |
| Blockchain  | **The main interface** must implement the block history, as well as the database of coins and transactions. |

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Features

- [x] The use of the blockchain may only be possible when utilizing the specified interfaces.
- [x] The product does not interact with any internal products and components except used libraries.
- [x] The classes do not provide for all scenarios of its using. User should be careful with them.
- [x] High security standards using ECDSA and SHA3.
- [x] The blockchain interface may be used by anyone without any restrictions.
